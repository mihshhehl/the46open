          <p>Wish that I was on ole rocky top, down in the Tennessee hills. Ain’t no smoggy smoke on rocky top, ain’t no telephone bills. Once there was a girl on rocky top, half bear the other half cat. Wild as a mink, sweet as soda pop, I still dream about that. Rocky top, you’ll always be home sweet home to me. Good ole Rocky Top, Rocky top Tennessee, Rocky Top Tennessee.</p>
